		<h1><a href="https://bitbucket.org/omsmith/js-webaudio-waveforms" target="_blank">WebAudio waveforms</a></h1>

		<p>This was a quick test of the up-and-coming html5 <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/intro/" target="_blank">WebAudio APIs</a> (in webkit). It clearly isn't implemented particularly well, but it did do what I set out to do. In JavaScript, a selected audio file is loaded completely into the limited memory available, and then draws a simple waveform representation of the file in canvas. It tends to crash your browser around 15MB files.</p>

		<p>Playing with this came up after reading <a href="http://www.themaninblue.com/writing/perspective/2012/09/18/" target="_blank">another experiment</a> from <em>The Man In Blue</em> and previously researching ways of generating waveforms for social media platforms.</p>

		<p>While I'd been following <a href="http://meteor.com" target-"_blank">meteor</a> since it was initially announced, I hadn't found something I could make which would take advtantage of some of the nicities it would provide. Once they released the authentication framework, I decided to have a go. So, over a weekend, I put together a basic scrum board with points and tasks and sprints (oh my!). We'd been struggling with/hating on redmine for a while at work, so putting together something which could potentially solve some of those pain points added a bit of motivation. I never finished anything, of course.</p>
