		<p>Some random thought experiments that I throw together from time to time.</p>

		<p>This was a quick test of the up-and-coming html5 <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/intro/" target="_blank">WebAudio APIs</a> (in webkit). It clearly isn't implemented particularly well, but it did do what I set out to do. In JavaScript, a selected audio file is loaded completely into the limited memory available, and then draws a simple waveform representation of the file in canvas. It tends to crash your browser around 15MB files.</p>

		<p>Playing with this came up after reading <a href="http://www.themaninblue.com/writing/perspective/2012/09/18/" target="_blank">another experiment</a> from <em>The Man In Blue</em> and previously researching ways of generating waveforms for social media platforms.</p>
