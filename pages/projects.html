		<h1>Projects</h1>

		<p>Some slightly larger projects; mostly things I've worked on in my spare time while not otherwise working. In general, they are still rough around the edges, having halted development once they did what they needed.</p>

		<h1><a href="https://bitbucket.org/omsmith/oweekleaderprofiles" target="_blank">Orientation leader profiles</a></h1>

		<p>A "simple" (read as "over-engineered") profile system for math frosh week leaders at Waterloo. Two years prior to this, information was managed through a combination of memory and e-mail. The year after that, it ended up in a fairly decent excel sheet. But still, each year, the same questions were asked of the same people time and time again. Hopefully this gets rid of some of that.</p>

		<p>I've had a pretty large hand in the design and construction of the websites for math frosh week the past two years. They've been pretty tame thus far. Moving forward, it's time to do something a bit fancier. Screw wordpress, they don't really need it. lets go static compilation. Still need to figure out a good way to help everyone transition from year to year&hellip;</p>
